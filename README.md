### Problem

Since College, I have been using [Speed Dial 2 Pro](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/speed-dial-2/jpfpebmajhhopeonhlcgidhclcccjcik?hl=en) for collecting important links and other stuff. It gives a very nice speed dial on the new tab page and collecting links is also very intuitive. But it doesn't let me export my links in a standard bookmarks html file, it instead exports a very big json file, which no browser imports.


So I created this tool mainly to export json bookmarks file to html bookmarks file, which every browser will import. I have added a sample json bookmarks file `bookmarks.sample.json` and corresponding html bookmarks file `bookmarks.sample.html`, which I generated by using this script.


### Usage

```bash

```
